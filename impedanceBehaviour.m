% This function plot the behaviour of the impedance at different layers,
% this is with the objective to see until what point the assumption of
% 377ohm is valid for the caracterization of the antenna. 


% ToDo: plot the surface of impedance in one layer

% ToDo: plot the mean impedance with std intervals with respect to z
