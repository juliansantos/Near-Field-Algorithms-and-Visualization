% DESCRIPTION:
% This function can used for antenna diagnostics, by taking planar near-field
% measured data, i.e. the vertically and horizonally measured tangential 
% E-fields, and back projecting them to the E-fields across the aperture 
% of the antenna under test (AUT). To prevent aliasing spatial sampling
% steps should be less than half the wave length.
%
% Note that often an open ended waveguide is used as a probe for planar 
% measurements, therefore it is expected that probe correction has been 
% applied to the measured data before using this function.
%
% This script is based on the 5 steps described by Balanis in [1, pg. 706].
% Inspiration for writing this script was also taken from [2].
% 
% PARMAETERS:
%   E_meas_x:   Planar Near-Field Horizontally Measured Data
%   E_meas_y:   Planar Near-Field Vertically Measured Data
%   z_0:        Distance between probe and AUT [m]
%   f:          Frequency [Hz]
